                                <p>First of all thank you for taking the time to view my profile. I made this profile as a portfolio prior to my application to CADA-copenhagen.
                                    I just wanted to say that although i may not be an expert in coding or graphic design the interest i have for it is very big and i am sure that if i am to be accepted into the school i will do great things as i progress withing the school and ultimately the community as well.
                                    I am a very down to earth guy and love helping others if the issue is something i am capable of giving tips and assisting with.
                                    It took a long time for me to realise what it was that i wanted to study and being 26 years old i realise that i may not be the youngest student out there but despite being on the older side i have learned many things which i can utilize in the study.
                                    Ever since i was a kid whenever i would hear a song or see a landscape or even have dream i would withing seconds start developing a scene where it would be recreated in a film or animation, i just never had the tools nor the experience to do so my self which is why i want to apply to CADA in hope to develop exactly that expereience and acquire the tools necessary to do so.
                                    Many in my family are working in the video game industry and i have contacts to become an intern at their companies when i have some sort of education in that field on my resumé.
                                    I truly hope that i will be accepted into CADA and i have already enrolled into the bootcamp which CADA offers to try and be as prepared as i possibly can prior to enrollment.

                                    p.s I made this website without any prior web desing experience so i apologize in advance for a skimpy portfolio but i hope it is enough for the application.
                                </p>
