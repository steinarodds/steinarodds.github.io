								<h2>Introduction</h2>
                                <p>My name is Steinar Oddsson and i am a 26 year old student living in Iceland.
                                    Almost all of my life i have been very interested in both video games and video game design, although never chased any sort of study to learn the aspects of that industry.
                                    Most of my career i have spent in the Aquacultural businness focusing on landbased aquaculture and fish farming. 
                                    Although this was not something i had always wanted to study this was something i had the most experience in prior to my education and i had been working in that field of work since i was 13 years old.
                                    Recently i enrolled in the University of Akureyri in Iceland to learn marine biology to add to my to prior education of landbased aquaculture, after a short time i realised that this is not something i wish to study and
                                    could already feel that a career change was needed and after spending most of my free time learning the basics of coding and graphic design i came to the decision that video game design was something that i wish to chase and study.
                                    I am the type of person that when i grab an interest i get completely sucked into it and commit almost all of my free time into that interest, which is as of this moment coding and graphic design ( modding).
                                    This is also one of the main reasons i am dedicated and hopefull to start studying in that field of interest.

                                </p>
								<h2>Hobbies and interests</h2>
                                <p>As you may have realised i have a big interest in video game design and graphic design. I may not have the biggest knowledge in that field but it is something i have a huge interest in and I would consider myself a very fast learner when it comes to something i have developed an interest in.
                                Apart from these hobbies i like to travel, go on walks and generally just enjoy nature. I am huge fan of swimming pools and hot tubs and tend to go to them almost every day if i am able.
