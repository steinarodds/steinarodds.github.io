						<h1>My projects</h1>
						<p>Here you can see all of my projects with documentation.
                            All of these projects are from when i attempted to make my own server for the video game Dayz. Back then i had no knowledge or experience in coding and wanted to make a completely new environment for the players.
                            It became too big of a project for me as i had to learn almost everything from scratch and it was only myself working on the server. Eventually i had to discontinue this project due to not having the time and on multiple occations i came to a stop due to not having the required expertise in coding.
                            I just want to point out that i am by no means an experienced coder nor am i experienced in graphic design so these projects will probably seem on a novice level compared to other projects out there.
                            All of my projects source code and images are on my Github, the link to my Github can be found by clicking on the Github logo at the bottom of the page.

                                    <h2>This is a mod i created for Dayz to use on my server. So the idea was that during a time set in the source code of the mod there would be a sound played as shown in the video above. As well as the "horror" sound playing the players would be sent into a "panic state" which you can hear after the sound plays sort of "cold sound". but the game didn't really have a panic state so the player was prompted with a cold state. (it was the most likely behaviour i could find)
                                        The idea was that during that time the zombies would all get swapped out for other zombies which would have red eyes and run instead of walking which is how i had modded the zombies behaviour.
                            It's a very simple code but it was the first code i wrote.

                                <p>This was my pride and joy where i overwrote the main menu's default setting which was as mentioned quite default lol, But i had implemented a completely overhauled main menu GUI a long with a overhauled main music and click sound prompts. 
                                    Along with these new additions there was also added  "real time" npc animations where the characters where prompted to animations which existed in the game and where looping those animations to add an immersive feeling.
                                    I also added all of the social prompts for the server which you can see on the right hand side.
                                <h2>Dayz's default environment</h2>  <img src="assets/images/Default.jpg" height="400" width="800" img/> 

                                <h1>Stalkers Paradise GUI</h1>
                                <img src="steinarodds.github.io/images/GUI.jpg" height="400" width="800" img/> 
                                <h2>This was a mod i created with some help from other coders which overhauls the ingame default GUI.
                                    So the default GUI's stamina had a sort of bar that went down as you ran ingame and up as you rested. I decided to utilize that as i felt the default setting of the GUI was quite boring and less interactive.
                                    I utilized the stamina bar to create a more interactive and uptadable status for hunger, thirst and all of the stats that you would need to keep an eye on.
                                    Instead of looking at the GUI and have a simple up or down icon telling you how your status was going, i used the bar from the stamina and added prompts to the right hand side which would tell you your state.
                                    for example if you went below a certain value on hunger by default it would turn Yellow if you were "medium" hungry, however with my mod it would state You are hungry, You are starving and other prompts to indicate what state your your indicator was in.
                                    And the sheep on the right hand side was an exeperimental mod which i discontinued which aimed to indicate your humanity based on your actions, the sheep meaning you were a fresh spawn or a "bambi" in the dayz lingo. 
                                    The original dayz mod which eventually developed into the standalone game had a humanity system which was not added into the standalone version of the game.

								<h1>Stalkers Paradise Gasmasks</h1>
								<h2>Here i started developing a mod where certain item's or clothing would bring up a vignette or a overlay. A long with it bringing up a certain interface i also made it so that depending on the items condition (pristine,worn,damaged,badly damaged,ruined).
									Based on these conditions the overlay would change. 
								For example here would be the overlay for a worn condition hazmat suit. </h2>

								<h2>After expanding the mod to a few items and making it work i decided that i wanted to add more gasmasks into the game. So i started to port over gasmasks from other various games such as fallout 4,Metro and stalker.</h2>

								<img src="assets/images/5.PNG" height="400" width="400" img/> 
								<h2>Although i never actually finished this mod and the pictures provided are unrendered textures, i still have all of the resources on my dropbox.A few months later the developers of dayz implemented a core feature which brought exactly what i had been working on to the game, they added overlays for all helmets/gasmasks and even added a very nice framework were the community could simply swap simple lines of code to create their own custom overlay.
